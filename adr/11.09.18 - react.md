# For now, do not use react

When discussing whether we want to use react or not 
we found that we have different opinions.

- it requires specialised knowledge 
- it is unclear which concrete benefits we get at this stage from using react
- it is much easier to add a framework to an existing project than it is to remove it again.

Until we have concrete problems which react can solve for us, we stay without a framework
in favor of simplicity.
